         <p>Hello, my name is Manuel and I was born in Cordoba , Spain, in October, 1985. </p>
         <p>I grew up in a beautiful town surrounded by Olives trees in Andalusia, the south of Spain. The olive oil made at my hometown is one of a kind.</p>

         <p> I studied a Bsc. in Computer Engineering at the University of Cordoba and moved to Milan(Italy) to complete my Computer Science studies. After my graduation, I moved to Madrid, the capital of Spain, to begin my professional career. In 2013 I decided to move to Germany, working for a Software company in Munich. My recent experience living abroad was in 2016, I spent three months living in the beautiful city of Lyon, France.</p>

          <p>I like to consider myself a "Software artisan",  with experience in a varied technologies spectrum,  from enterprise, Web solutions, throught to the implementation of high-availability SaaS Cloud platform and third-party systems integration.</p>

         <p> Solution-maker and "Knowledge explorer" mindset, capable of the analysis, design and development of fine applications based on Agile approach and state-of-the-art Software principles.</p>

          <p> I entirely believe in being perseverant in learning, specially in Information Technology , Arts, Social Sciences, Philosophy and Music. Passionate about travelling the world. </p>

          <p>My next career step is to find a location-independent position as Software Engineer, Consultant or Full-Stack Developer. #remoteposition, #remotework, #remoter, #digitalnomad. </p>
